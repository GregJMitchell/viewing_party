        abandoned oil rig in the middle of the North Sea. Dr. Christine Hansen is
        charged with the task of testing an experimental cleaning fluid which could
        revolutionize the oil industry. Hired to carry out the tests is Jacob Rasmussen
        and his rough and ready crew of deconstruction engineers. But within hours
        one of them is missing under suspicious circumstances. Things go from bad
        to worse when environmental activist Mickey Hennessey and his hard-bitten
        associates seize control of the rig, taking everybody on board hostage. But
        very soon oil workers and environmentalists will be compelled to join forces
        in an evolutionary battle for survival. For a savage new life-form has made
        its home on the rig. And it is hungry.","popularity":6.715,"poster_path":"/lDsUWvTHbSsI62u63S8B6Jjgztb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United
